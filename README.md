This algorithm is based off of _Peter Litwinowicz_'s paper _Processing Images and Video for An Impressionist Effect_

## Set up

```shell
mkdir build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
./Impressionist
```

## Future work

Making sure that the gradient images are smoother so we get longer brush strokes.
